   <h1>Welcome fellow athlete of Lagos!</h1>
   <h6>to alpha space: <br>
    the page that lets you find 
    publicly accessable and safe locations 
     for your next work-out session!</h6>
   <h6>Explore the map below and find out how and where the citizens of Lagos use public spaces for physical activity.<br>
   or go on to apply some filters to find a location that suits you best! </h6>
   
   
      <p>The ALPhA study is a citizen science project established by UrbanBetter and Oni et al., funded by the British Academy's "Urban Infrastructures of Well-being" program. The program supports research that explores how formal and informal infrastructures interact to affect the well-being of citizens across the Global South (The British Academy, 2021). The urban infrastructures of rapdily developing megacities like Lagos, do not provide the citizens with equally accessible sites for the practice of safe physical exercise, such as parks or footpaths. Therefore the residents of Lagos are forced to appropriate other public spaces to be physically active, including roads, motorways, bridges and unoccupied land, often under hazardous conditions such as toxic air pollution and increased injury risk. This less-than-ideal solution, undeniably raises the health and safety risks for any athlete of Lagos that works-out in public. In some cases these risks even become so high, that they completely cancel out all the benefits associated with physical activiy! To drive change in the desired direction, and eventually cause a re-design of Lagos' urban infrastructure, the  citizen science project that is the ALPhA study (Appropriation of Public Space for Leisure Physical Activity) starts by trying to understand the types of spaces that exist, the experiences of people that use them, and the air pllution, safety, and injury risks people may be exposed to while being there. The resulting data can now be viewed and explored right here, wether you are an athlete of Lagos in need of a safe public space to train in, or an urban planner trying to better understand the interactions of the individual with its environment, you came to the right place!<br>
       Go sports, go team!</p>
